**GrasshopperChallenges** are a set of challenges *designed* to teach Grasshopper, by creating a set of active learning / problem-solving challenges. The challenges are designed to be fun, and also to highly limit the scope of each problem, so that learners can tackle one aspect of Grasshopper at a time.
