# GrasshopperChallenges (v0.2)
![gif example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/provolot/GrasshopperChallenges/master/Challenge_GIFs/ChallengeAExample.gif)

**GrasshopperChallenges** are a set of challenges designed to teach Grasshopper by creating a set of active learning / problem-solving challenges -- *learning-by-doing*, rather than *learning-by-watching-videos*. The challenges are designed to be fun, and also to highly limit the scope of each problem, so that learners can tackle one aspect of Grasshopper at a time.

(The challenges are being continually updated, so please check back once in a while for updated versions.)

## How to use this set of Challenges:

Download the files via the ZIP link above, or clone the repository.

- If you're new to Grasshopper, I highly recommend reviewing the 'Node Logic' and 'Grasshopper Intro' videos on the [GSAPP Skill Tree](http://skilltree.gsapp.org/), then starting with `GH_Challenges_A_Intro_to_Grasshopper.ghx`. 

- If you're more comfortable with Grasshopper, I recommend starting with `GH_Challenges_B_Logic.ghx` and onwards.

- If you're looking to start with Grasshopper & representational techniques, I recommend starting with `GH_Challenges_E_representation.ghx`
